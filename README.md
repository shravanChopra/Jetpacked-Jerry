Jetpacked Jerry is a 2D infinite side-scroller made in Unity.

Inspired by the famous 'Jetpack Joyride', the game features a mouse strapped with a jetpack, flying through a house trying to collect
coins and avoid lasers. The game increases in difficulty as more coins are collected.

Future versions will hopefully feature more obstacles, collectibles and power-ups, and provide an engaging experience for the player.

This project was developed using Unity v.2017.2, and was built to iOS (Xcode project coming soon!).
